In order to properly install these, put them in the 
same folder that the Pitt_RedBot_Library_v3.1. Your directory structure
should look like this:

\
 |-Pitt_RedBot_Library_v3.1
 |-pollserial
 |-TVout
 |-TVoutfonts

To make sure they have been installed, open arduino and do:
Sketch->Include Library->Manage Libraries
search for each of the folders you've added 
(pollserial, TVout, TVoutfonts), and make sure it says
"Installed" next to the name
